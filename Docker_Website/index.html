                <b>Introduction:</b> <br>
                When I first laid hands on a Nintendo 64 controller in 2001, a lifelong fascination with technology was
                born. <br>
                Fueled by curiosity, I spent my youth dismantling and dissecting the electronic components that <br>
                surrounded me. As my expertise grew, so did my love for sharing my knowledge and skills with those
                around me.<br>
                This culminated when i jailbroke my ipod touch 3rd gen. This spawned an <u><i>Tech-obsession</i></u>
                <br>

                        <p>Ever since I played Nintendo 64 for the first time in 2001, I've been fascinated by
                            technology. I started by taking apart components in my house and evolved into a tech-savvy
                            problem solver. After running my own small-scale tech business, I ventured into plumbing and
                            gained valuable experience in commercial sites and on-call service. Now, I've returned to my
                            true passion: cybersecurity.</p>
